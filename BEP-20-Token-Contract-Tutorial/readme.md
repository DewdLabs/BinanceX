## Project Satoshi: Beginner tutorial
**Project Satoshi is a list of milestones an aspiring developer can self-start in order to guide themselves along a solid path to proficiency in dapp development. The list is sequential, as later milestones may depend on previous ones. It is recommended that individuals start from the beginning no matter what their level. This tutorial should be an exemplary completion of the milestone, but structured as a tutorial**
